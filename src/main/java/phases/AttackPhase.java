//        iii. Cancel pairs of 󲁨 and 󲁄 results
//        iv. Determine whether the defender is hit by the attack or the attack misses
//
//
//    Did the attack hit?
//    yes: go to 7
//
//    7. “Deal Damage” step
//        i. Remove shield tokens to cancel 󲁧 results
//        ii. Remove shield tokens to cancel 󲁨 results
//        iii. The defender is dealt facedown damage cards for remaining 󲁧 results
//        iv. The defender is dealt faceup damage cards for remaining 󲁨 results
//
//
//    no and after (7)
//    Is this the first attack from a secondary weapon that says “Perform this attack twice”?
//
//    yes:  go to (2)

//        i. Resolve abilities of player with initiative
//        ii. Resolve abilities of other player
//
//    9. Abilities trigger that occur “after attacking” or “after defending” that perform an attack
//            (such as BTL-A4 Y-wing, Dengar [ship], Gunner, etc.)
//        i. Resolve 1 ability of player with initiative
//        ii. If you did not resolve an ability in step (i) resolve 1 ability of other player
//
//
//    are you resolving an ability in step 9:
//        yes: go to (1)
//        no: go to (10)
//
//    10. Remove destroyed ships
//        Remove the attacker if that ship was kept in play due to Simultaneous Attack Rule
//        Simultaneous Attack Rule may prevent a destroyed ship from being removed
