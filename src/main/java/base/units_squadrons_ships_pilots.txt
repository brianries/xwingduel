The base class for interacting with the rules engine is the Unit.
Pilot and Ship are modifiers to the Unit.

UnitRegistry is a singleton to manage all units.
All Units will get a unique UnitId when it is created.

Squadron is a group of Units friendly to each other.
If an ability/event triggers for friendlies, it will be available
in the Squadron container.  It will be self referenced within a Unit.

Ship adds basic stats/actions to Unit
Pilot adds special stats/actions to Unit

All EventTriggers will be based off of the Unit class.
