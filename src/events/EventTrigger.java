 * Created by dsayles on 2/8/16.
 *
 * Can be set at specific phases or on specific actions or ships or whatever to send an event
 * when it would be triggered...
 *
 * e.g. Push The Limit contains an EventTrigger that will throw an event to add a Stress
 *      to the source UnitId
 *
 *      Determination sets an EventTrigger on the Unit Damage step to ignore Pilot based Crits
